      "full": "The Slide-Rock Bolter is a fearsome critter from American lumberjack folklore, particularly associated with Colorado's Rocky Mountains. Described as an enormous whale-sized creature with a fish-like body and massive mouth, it was said to live on mountain peaks, waiting for tourists to gather in valleys below. When sufficient prey assembled, the Bolter would release its grip and slide down the mountain at tremendous speed with its mouth wide open, swallowing everything - tourists, horses, wagons - in a single gulp. So large that one Bolter could consume an entire tour group, the creature was documented in William T. Cox's 1910 fearsome critters collection and served as a humorous tall tale to mock tourists visiting Colorado's mountains."
